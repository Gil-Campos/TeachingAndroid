# Day 2: Kotlin Basics & XML Layouts

- **Topics**
    - Kotlin basics: Variables, Data Types, Functions, and Control Flow (if, when,loops).
    - Introduction to the XML layout system.
    - Understanding TextView, Button, and EditText.
    - Basic LinearLayout and RelativeLayout.

- **Homework**
    - Create a Kotlin console app that accepts user input (name and age), then prints a greeting. In a new line, display the sum of the number of letters in the name and the age. On another line indicate whether the sum is odd or even.
    - Set up a simple "Hello World" app in Android Studio with a button that displays a Toast message showing how many times the user has clicked the button and whether the count is odd or even.
    - Commit both projects to a local repository and push them to a remote repository. Ensure the repository has multiple commits, not just one commit containing all changes.
